# Microsoft Entra ID SPA and API Setup

The previous post provided some <a href='updated-api-coding-key-points.mdx'>API Code Details</a> for the second code sample. Next I port the code sample to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id) and use the same libraries in the SPA and API.

### Main Objective

The goal of the Entra ID code sample is to match the <a href='improved-spa-code-sample-overview.mdx'>Second SPA and API Code Sample</a>, ideally with exactly the same code. Only the configuration should need changing:

| Area | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Authorization Server Integration | The SPA and API integrate with Entra ID and this post explains the authorization server settings. |
| Same Security Libraries | I use the same open source standards-based libraries and the same main application code. |
| Minor Vendor Differences | I minimize the impact of any vendor-specific code required by either AWS Cognito or Microsoft Entra ID. |

### SPAs in 2021

This example SPA uses the traditional SPA solution, with a JavaScript OpenID Connect implementation. It is now considered more secure for your production apps to instead use a <a href='spa-back-end-for-front-end.mdx'>Backend for Frontend</a> approach. Before this blog integrates a BFF it explains the traditional SPA flow and the web development and deployment benefits it enables.

The traditional SPA flow remains useful to represent a pure SPA architecture and to learn about Entra ID integration. This blog's <a href='final-spa-overview.mdx'>Final SPA</a> provides a BFF based solution, but requires a more complex flow.

### Code Download

Clone the code sample's GitHub repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.websample.entraid
```

### Local Computer Hosting

In this post I explain some setup details for the Entra ID authorization server. The following components run at these URLs in the end-to-end flow:

| Component | URL |
| --------- | --- |
| Secured API | *https://api.authsamples-dev.com/api* |
| Secured SPA | *https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa* |

To get a working system you would need to follow the steps in this post for your own Microsoft account and then reconfigure the apps. The configuration is a little complex though, due to my requirement to issue custom claims to access tokens.

### Step 1. Azure Sign Up

I used the [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/) offer and signed up for a developer account:

![azure trial](../images/190/azure-trial.jpg)

### Step 2. Log in to the Entra ID Portal

After email confirmation I visited [https://entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com) and could manage a directory whose domain name is based on by registration email:

![azure directory](../images/190/azure-directory.jpg)

Note the *Tenant ID*, since the *Authorization Server Base URL* has the following form:

- *https://login.microsoftonline.com/[tenantid]/v2.0*

The *OpenID Connect Discovery Endpoint* for my developer account is therefore at the following location:

- [https://login.microsoftonline.com/7f071fbc-8bf2-4e61-bb48-dabd8e2f5b5a/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://login.microsoftonline.com/7f071fbc-8bf2-4e61-bb48-dabd8e2f5b5a/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration)

### Step 3. Configure Test User Accounts

Next I navigated to *Users* and created the two users for testing to match those in the previous code sample:

![test accounts](../images/190/test-accounts.jpg)

I created the *Guest User* and *Guest Admin* accounts with the following login names based on my domain:

- *guestuser@[mytenant].onmicrosoft.com*
- *guestadmin`@`[mytenant].onmicrosoft.com*

I assigned each user *First name* and *Last name* fields. The *Object ID* field is the unique account identifier of each user account:

![built in user attributes](../images/190/built-in-user-attributes.jpg)

I then did an initial login for each user with the following steps in a new incognito browser window, to configure the user for MFA, as Entra ID requires. I used the Google authenticator app on my mobile device.

- In the Entra ID Portal, reset the user's password to get a temporary one.
- Login to the SPA and reset the password when prompted.
- There follows a prompt to create an entry in an authenticator app.
- The browser login form then presents a QR code.
- On my mobile device I scanned the QR code in my authenticator app.
- In the browser I then entered the authenticator app's one-time-code.

On all subsequent logins I only enter the username and password, until I am again prompted for a new one-time-code from the authenticator app.

### Step 4. Register an OAuth Client for the API

My SPA client uses scopes and in Entra ID you create scopes within an OAuth client. Since scopes are an API concern that should be shareable across multiple clients I created an API client called *BasicAPI*, without selecting a platform. I use this client to represent a logical collection of one or more APIs for an *investments* business area. Access tokens later use the below *Client ID* in their *audience* claim:

![api client](../images/190/api-client.jpg)

The API client registration defines scopes. I navigated to *Expose an API* and created a custom scope called *investments*:

![api custom scope](../images/190/api-custom-scope.jpg)

The API later acts as a client to the Microsoft Graph endpoint, to get userinfo. Under *API Permissions*, I selected *Add a permission / Microsoft Graph / Delegated permissions* and added the *openid* and *profile* built-in OpenID Connect scopes. I also selected the *Grant Admin Consent for Default Directory* option:

![api permissions](../images/190/api-permissions.jpg)

Next, I created a client secret which the API uses when it connects to Microsoft Graph:

![api client secret](../images/190/api-client-secret.jpg)

### Step 5. Register an OAuth Client for the SPA

Under *Applications / App Registrations*, I selected *New Registration* and added a client called *BasicSPA*, selecting the *Single Page Application* platform type.

![spa client](../images/190/spa-client.jpg?v=20250921)

Next, I navigated to *API Permissions*, selected *Add a permission / My APIs* and chose the *investments* scope. Again I selected the *Grant Admin Consent for Default Directory* option:

![spa permissions](../images/190/spa-permissions.jpg)

### Step 6. Populate Custom User Attributes

Next I defined two custom attributes to store against user accounts in the identity data, to match the setup from the <a href='user-data.mdx'>User Data</a> post. Once populated against user accounts, these attributes are included in access tokens issued to the SPA client:

| User Attribute | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| manager_id | A business user identity that the API receives in access tokens. |
| role | A user role that the API uses in its authorization logic. |

I navigated to the *Custom User Attributes* screen and added the fields to the user accounts schema:

![custom user attributes](../images/190/custom-user-attributes.jpg)

Populating these values for my two test user accounts was a little convoluted and took me some time to understand. Eventually, I created a new client called *UserAdmin* without setting a platform. I then generated a client secret. In total my account uses the following registrations:

![app registrations](../images/190/app-registrations.jpg)

Entra ID automatically creates the extensions app and stores custom user attributes there. The *UserAdmin* app is a backend client for administering all user accounts with the client credentials flow. Therefore I granted it *User.ReadWriteAll* application permissions (not delegated permissions). To populate the values for my two test user accounts I had to write some client code to call the Graph API. I did this as a bash script that uses the [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) tool. The code sample repository contains the script:

- [utils/populate_custom_user_attributes.sh](https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.websample.entraid/blob/master/utils/populate-custom-user-attributes.sh)

My two custom user attributes are extension attributes with the following full technical names. The middle part is the client ID of the extensions app registration with hyphens removed:

- extension_32ee1b779fea4ee2be2dcaf30f23d83a_manager_id
- extension_32ee1b779fea4ee2be2dcaf30f23d83a_role

### Step 7. Issue Custom Access Token Claims

To customise access tokens you edit the API client registration, starting by selecting the following link:

![edit api client](../images/190/edit-api-client.jpg)

A *Single Sign On* tab is then available from which you can select *Attributes & Claims*. Here I added the custom claims using a source location of *Directory Schema Extension*. I used a *custom_* prefix to avoid conflicts with the built-in *role* claim:

![directory schema extensions](../images/190/directory-schema-extensions.jpg)

### Step 8. Download the Code Sample

You can then download the code, then open it in Visual Studio Code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.websample.entraid
```

Identify the configuration files containing OAuth settings used by the UI and API:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/190/code-layout.jpg?v=20251230' alt='code layout' />
</div>

### Step 9. Update SPA Configuration

For the SPA update both the *Tenant ID* and the SPA's *Client ID* to your own value:

```json
{
    "app": {
        "apiBaseUrl":             "https://api.authsamples-dev.com:446/api"
    },
    "oauth": {
        "authority":              "https://login.microsoftonline.com/7f071fbc-8bf2-4e61-bb48-dabd8e2f5b5a/v2.0",
        "clientId":               "e9a29a01-21b4-4533-bae6-438141ebc05c",
        "redirectUri":            "https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa/",
        "postLogoutRedirectUri":  "https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa#loggedout",
        "scope":                  "openid api://552b475c-471d-43a1-9dfe-f6b895931110/investments"
    }
}
```

### Step 10. Update API Configuration

For the API configuration, replace the *Tenant ID* with your own value. Also update the *Audience* and *Client ID* values with those for the API:

```json
{
    "api": {
        "port": 446,
        "sslCertificateFileName": "../certs/authsamples-dev.ssl.p12",
        "sslCertificatePassword": "Password1",
        "trustedOrigins": [
            "https://www.authsamples-dev.com"
        ],
        "useProxy": false,
        "proxyUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
    },
    "oauth": {
        "jwksEndpoint":                  "https://login.microsoftonline.com/7f071fbc-8bf2-4e61-bb48-dabd8e2f5b5a/discovery/v2.0/keys",
        "tokenEndpoint":                 "https://login.microsoftonline.com/7f071fbc-8bf2-4e61-bb48-dabd8e2f5b5a/oauth2/v2.0/token",
        "userInfoEndpoint":              "https://graph.microsoft.com/oidc/userinfo",
        "issuer":                        "https://login.microsoftonline.com/7f071fbc-8bf2-4e61-bb48-dabd8e2f5b5a/v2.0",
        "audience":                      "552b475c-471d-43a1-9dfe-f6b895931110",
        "algorithm":                     "RS256",
        "scope":                         "investments",
        "claimsCacheTimeToLiveMinutes":  15,
        "graphClient": {
            "clientId":                  "552b475c-471d-43a1-9dfe-f6b895931110",
            "clientSecret":              "VFu8Q~i~l3Ysiji~jvBgmDphm_IhDLuuOTapkaCe",
            "scope":                     "openid profile"
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration is equivalent to that of the earlier <a href='improved-spa-code-sample-overview.mdx'>Updated SPA and API</a>, which ran against AWS Cognito. The Graph details in the configuration are explained in the next post.

### Step 11. Configure DNS and SSL

Update the hosts file on your computer to include this blog's local development domains, described in the earlier <a href='oauth-infrastructure-setup.mdx'>OAuth Infrastructure Setup</a> post:

```markdown
127.0.0.1 www.authsamples-dev.com api.authsamples-dev.com
```

The API and web static content hosting use SSL so you must create development certificates. Ensure that OpenSSL 3+ is installed and then run the following commands:

```bash
export SECRETS_FOLDER="$HOME/secrets"
mkdir "$SECRETS_FOLDER"
./certs/create.sh
```

Then ensure that your browser trusts the root certificate at the following location, as explained in the <a href='developer-ssl-setup.mdx'>SSL Trust Configuration</a> post.

```markdown
certs/authsamples-dev.ca.crt
```

### Step 12. Build and Run the SPA and API

Next, run the following script, to build the code and run the API over SSL on port 443. The default browser then runs at *https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa/*. The SPA redirects to Entra ID and you can sign in with one of the test user accounts:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Login completes successfully and you can run the same SPA and API that I previously ran against AWS Cognito. There are some minor OAuth differences but both apps use essentially the same code.

### Where Are We?

I have provided a working Entra ID setup and in the next post I explain further details about the SPA and API OAuth end-to-end flow.
