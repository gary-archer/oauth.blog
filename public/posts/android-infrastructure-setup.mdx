# Android Code Sample - Infrastructure

Previously I showed ways to <a href='basicandroidapp-execution.mdx'>Run the Android Code Sample</a> and next I explain the Android infrastructure setup to enable reliable and secure OAuth integration.

### AWS CloudFront Domains

The Android app uses 2 online domains which I creates as part of this blog's <a href='cloud-domain-setup.mdx'>Cloud Domain Setup</a>:

| Domain | Usage |
| ------ | ----- |
| mobile.authsamples.com | The domain name for mobile deep linking, which points to a cloud location that hosts deep linking assets. |
| www.authsamples.com | I use part of the web domain to host external post-login and post-logout web pages. |

### External Web Page Hosting

The web pages are available in the *web* folder of the code sample's GitHub repository. I first uploaded them to an AWS S3 bucket:

![s3 bucket](../images/520/s3-bucket.jpg?v=20240912)

This blog's <a href='cdn-static-content-delivery.mdx'>Web CloudFront Distribution</a> then serves them using SSL:

![cloudfront distro](../images/520/cloudfront-distro.jpg?v=20240912)

Pages are then available at these HTTPS URLs:

- [https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogin.html](https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogin.html)
- [https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogout.html](https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogout.html)

### Deep Linking Assets File

To use claimed HTTPS scheme redirect URIs you must meet the requirements for [Android App Link Verification](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks). You must host a deep linking assets file at a trusted internet URL. The GitHub repository contains its assets file at *security/assetlinks.json*. The assets document associates the app's signing key and package name with its hosting domain:

```json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "com.authsamples.finalmobileapp",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints":
      ["DA:C6:0C:FD:EB:84:04:4D:F3:2F:D4:30:15:91:08:94:51:33:6B:8D:34:68:50:01:BC:E4:C7:53:F6:36:D9:41"]
    }
  }
]
```

The app's manifest file configures the use of deep linking URLs:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".plumbing.oauth.logout.LogoutRedirectUriReceiverActivity"
    android:exported="true">

    <intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/>
        <data
            android:scheme="https"
            android:host="mobile.authsamples.com"
            android:path="/finalmobileapp/oauth/logoutcallback" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

I uploaded the assets file to run at the below HTTPS URL, in a similar manner to the external web pages. I use a second S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution for the mobile subdomain:

- https://mobile.authsamples.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json

The *mobile.authsamples.com* S3 bucket has a *.well-known* folder containing the assets files for both Android and iOS:

![asset hosting](../images/520/asset-hosting.jpg?v=20240912)

### Deep Linking Online Verification

We can verify the assets file via a test site that Google provides, and check that results do not contain any errors:

```markdown
https://digitalassetlinks.googleapis.com/v1/statements:list?source.web.site=https://mobile.authsamples.com&relation=delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls
```

![deep linking verification](../images/520/deep-linking-verification.jpg?v=20240912)

### Deep Linking Registration Process

When the user installs the app, system commands run deep linking registration. To get some visibility into how this works, uninstall the app, then re-run it while viewing the logcat window. Filter on the word *Verification* to see the related entries:

![verification success](../images/520/verification-success.jpg?v=20240912)

You can execute the following command to query the domain's deep linking verification status on a device or emulator:

```bash
adb shell pm get-app-links com.authsamples.finalmobileapp
```

This should return a domain verification state of *verified*:

```markdown
com.authsamples.finalmobileapp:
  ID: a8d77973-3078-40e2-a860-76761575d29f
  Signatures: [DA:C6:0C:FD:EB:84:04:4D:F3:2F:D4:30:15:91:08:94:51:33:6B:8D:34:68:50:01:BC:E4:C7:53:F6:36:D9:41]
  Domain verification state:
    mobile.authsamples.com: verified
```

### Deep Linking Registration Failures

Deep linking registration can fail, and one way to reproduce this is to configure the mobile device to connect to the internet via an <a href='android-https-debugging.mdx'>HTTP Proxy</a>. The system's *Intent Filter Verifier* will not trust the HTTP proxy's man in the middle certificate. The app installs successfully but the claimed HTTPS scheme does not work for user logins:

![verification failure](../images/520/verification-failure.jpg?v=20240912)

If you re-run the command to query the deep linking verification status you will see a non-verified state:

```markdown
 com.authsamples.finalmobileapp:
    ID: d94b156e-150c-4d1c-9b6a-98d9758cda8e
    Signatures: [DA:C6:0C:FD:EB:84:04:4D:F3:2F:D4:30:15:91:08:94:51:33:6B:8D:34:68:50:01:BC:E4:C7:53:F6:36:D9:41]
    Domain verification state:
      mobile.authsamples.com: 1024
```

If you then run a deep link:

```bash
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d https://mobile.authsamples.com/finalmobileapp/deeplink/companies/2
```

You will see the following undesired behaviour, where the system browser tries to render a web page that does not exist rather than invoking a deep link:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/520/deep-link-failure.jpg?v=20240912' alt='deep link failure' />
</div>

### Switching to Private URI Scheme Redirect URIs

Private URI scheme redirect URIs are less secure than claimed HTTPS scheme redirect URIs. A malicious app could use your app's client ID and redirect URI and potentially trick the user into signing in. However, there are useful reasons for sometimes switching to using private URI scheme redirect URIs:

- If you need to fix deep linking registration failures on particular devices.
- To reduce the complexity of claimed HTTPS scheme redirect URIs during development.

In the Android code sample you can update the *mobile_config.json* file with the following settings:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "apiBaseUrl":             "https://api.authsamples.com/investments"
  },
  "oauth": {
    "authority":              "https://cognito-idp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/eu-west-2_CuhLeqiE9",
    "clientId":               "2vshs4gidsbpnjmsprhh607ege",
    "redirectUri":            "com.authsamples.finalmobileapp:/callback",
    "postLogoutRedirectUri":  "com.authsamples.finalmobileapp:/logoutcallback",
    "scope":                  "openid profile https://api.authsamples.com/investments",
    "userInfoEndpoint":       "https://login.authsamples.com/oauth2/userInfo",
    "customLogoutEndpoint":   "https://login.authsamples.com/logout",
    "deepLinkBaseUrl":        "https://mobile.authsamples.com"
  }
}
```

Also update *appAuthRedirectScheme* in the *app/build.gradle.kts* file as follows:

```markdown
manifestPlaceholders["appAuthRedirectScheme"] = "com.authsamples.finalmobileapp"
```

Finally, remove the *LogoutRedirectUriReceiverActivity* entry from the *AndroidManifest.xml* file. You will then be able to sign in and sign out without a dependency on deep linking registration succeeding:

### HTTP Debugging and Claimed HTTPS Schemes

I usually always do mobile development with claimed HTTPS scheme redirect URIs. To continue to use an HTTP proxy to view OAuth and API messages sent by the Android app I use the following steps. Android only registers App Links during app installation or upgrades, and not during redeployment from Android Studio:

- First install the app without running an HTTP proxy on the host computer so that deep linking registration succeeds.
- Start the HTTP proxy on the host computer and configure an Android emulator to use it.
- Then redeploy the app from Android Studio and capture messages from the app on the host computer.

### Android App Code Signing

Next, let's look at how I generated the signature from the assets file. Install the [Java KeyStore Explorer](https://keystore-explorer.org/downloads.html) and open the *app-keystore.jks* file from the GitHub repository. Type a password of *android* when prompted. I included this file in the demo app's GitHub repository so that anyone can sign in with HTTPS redirect URIs. For a real project you should never include crypto keys in source control.

To create the app's signing key I used the *Tools / Generate Key Pair* option to create an ECDSA key with default options and a 10 year validity. I then chose *Add Extensions / Use Standard Template / Code Signing* and included the *Subject Key Identifier* extension. I then used some naming to fit with this blog, and copied the below *SHA256 Fingerprint* to the mobile assets file:

![fingerprint](../images/520/fingerprint.jpg?v=20240912)

The app's *build.gradle.kts* file references the Android keystore file, which digitally signs the app during both debug and release builds.

```kotlin
signingConfigs {
    create("release") {
        storeFile = file("${rootDir}/security/app-keystore.jks")
        storePassword = "android"
        keyAlias = "com.authsamples.finalmobileapp"
        keyPassword = "android"
    }
}

buildTypes {
    getByName("debug") {
        signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
        isDebuggable = true
    }
    getByName("release") {
        signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
        isMinifyEnabled = false
        proguardFiles(
            getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android-optimize.txt"),
            "proguard-rules.pro"
        )
    }
}
```

When the app installs on a device, the Android system can verify that the public key hash in the mobile assets JSON document matches the private key that digitally signs the app.

### Where Are We?

I described the infrastructure plumbing that the Android app uses. To enable logins with claimed HTTPS scheme redirect URIs you must first prepare mobile and cloud infrastructure.
