# iOS Code Sample - Infrastructure

Previously I showed ways to <a href='how-to-run-the-ios-code-sample.mdx'>Run the iOS Code Sample</a> and next I explain the iOS infrastructure setup to enable reliable and secure OAuth integration.

### AWS CloudFront Domains

The iOS app uses 2 online domains which I created as part of this blog's <a href='cloud-domain-setup.mdx'>Cloud Domain Setup</a>:

| Domain | Usage |
| ------ | ----- |
| mobile.authsamples.com | The domain name for mobile deep linking, which points to a cloud location that hosts deep linking assets. |
| www.authsamples.com | I use part of the web domain to host external post-login and post-logout web pages. |

### External Web Page Hosting

The web pages are available in the *web* folder of the code sample's GitHub repository. I first uploaded them to an AWS S3 bucket:

![s3 bucket](../images/560/s3-bucket.jpg?v=20240914)

This blog's <a href='cdn-static-content-delivery.mdx'>Web CloudFront Distribution</a> then serves them using SSL:

![cloudfront distro](../images/560/cloudfront-distro.jpg?v=20240914)

Pages are then available at these HTTPS URLs:

- [https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogin.html](https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogin.html)
- [https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogout.html](https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogout.html)

### Deep Linking Assets File

To use claimed HTTPS scheme redirect URIs you must meet the requirements for [iOS Universal Link Verification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains). You must host a deep linking assets file at a trusted internet URL. The GitHub repository contains its assets file at *security/.well-known/apple-app-site-association*. The assets document associates the app's *Unique ID* with its *Hosting Domain*:

```json
{
    "applinks": {
        "apps": [],
        "details": [
            {
                "appID": "U3VTCHYEM7.com.authsamples.finalmobileapp",
                "paths": [ "/finalmobileapp/*" ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The app configures *Associated Domains* in a *finalmobileapp.entitlements* file to enable the use of deep linking domains:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>com.apple.developer.associated-domains</key>
	<array>
		<string>applinks:mobile.authsamples.com?mode=developer</string>
	</array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

I uploaded the assets file to run at the below HTTPS URL, in a similar manner to the external web pages. I use a second S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution for the mobile subdomain:

- [https://mobile.authsamples.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association](https://mobile.authsamples.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association)

The *mobile.authsamples.com* S3 bucket has a *.well-known* folder containing the assets files for both Android and iOS:

![asset hosting](../images/560/asset-hosting.jpg)

You must configure the assets file in S3 to return a content type of *application/json*:

![content type](../images/560/content-type.jpg)

### Deep Linking Online Verification

You can use the following test site to verify the configuration:

- [https://branch.io/resources/aasa-validator](https://branch.io/resources/aasa-validator)

On success the site shows validated results:

![deep linking verification](../images/560/deep-linking-verification.jpg?v=20240914)

### Deep Linking Registration Process

During installation you can run the macOS *Console App* from *Finder / Applications / Utilities*. Select the simulator, ensure that tracing has started, and filter output on the *mobile.authsamples.com* domain name. A successful registration results in output like this:

![ios debug success](../images/560/ios-debug-success.jpg?v=20240713)

Yet some developers may experience errors when running the app. A failed registration results in output like this:

![ios debug failure](../images/560/ios-debug-failure.jpg?v=20240713)

### Switching to Private URI Scheme Redirect URIs

Private URI scheme redirect URIs are less secure than claimed HTTPS scheme redirect URIs. A malicious app could use your app's client ID and redirect URI and potentially trick the user into signing in. However, there are useful reasons for sometimes switching to using private URI scheme redirect URIs:

- If you need to fix deep linking registration failures on particular devices.
- To reduce the complexity of claimed HTTPS scheme redirect URIs during development.

In the iOS code sample you can update the *mobile_config.json* file with the following settings:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "apiBaseUrl":             "https://api.authsamples.com/investments"
  },
  "oauth": {
    "authority":              "https://cognito-idp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/eu-west-2_CuhLeqiE9",
    "clientId":               "2vshs4gidsbpnjmsprhh607ege",
    "redirectUri":            "com.authsamples.finalmobileapp:/callback",
    "postLogoutRedirectUri":  "com.authsamples.finalmobileapp:/logoutcallback",
    "scope":                  "openid profile https://api.authsamples.com/investments",
    "userInfoEndpoint":       "https://login.authsamples.com/oauth2/userInfo",
    "customLogoutEndpoint":   "https://login.authsamples.com/logout",
    "deepLinkBaseUrl":        "https://mobile.authsamples.com"
  }
}
```

### Fixing Claimed HTTPS Redirect URIs

You can use development mode to run the iOS code sample with working claimed HTTPS scheme logins. To do so, run the following commands and override the Apple Team ID and Bundle ID with your own values:

```bash
export APPLE_TEAM_ID='MYTEAMID'
export BUNDLE_ID='com.myorganization.finalmobileapp'
./DevelopmentWebServer/run.sh
```

You can study the script to see how it creates an SSL certificate and key, registers the root certificate authority as trusted on the simulator, then runs an HTTPS web server, to serve a deep linking assets file that uses your Apple Team ID and Bundle ID. Next, update the */etc/hosts* file on your MacBook, to alias the deep linking domain to localhost:

```markdown
127.0.0.1 mobile.authsamples.com
```

Finally, configure Xcode to use the same Apple Team ID and Bundle ID. Then re-run the app on the simulator:

![code signing](../images/560/code-signing.jpg?v=20240914)

Since the app uses [mode=developer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_associated-domains),, deep linking verification should succeed. This technique is only useful for local development and for a real app you must instead provide your own iOS infrastructure.

### HTTP Debugging and Claimed HTTPS Schemes

I usually always do mobile development with claimed HTTPS scheme redirect URIs. To continue to use an HTTP proxy to view OAuth and API messages sent by the iOS app I use the following steps. iOS re-registers universal links every time you run it from Xcode:

- First install the app without running an HTTP proxy on the host MacBook so that deep linking registration succeeds.
- Start the HTTP proxy on the host MacBook and configure an iOS simulator to use it.
- Then capture messages from the app on the host MacBook.

### Where Are We?

I described the infrastructure plumbing that the iOS app uses. To enable logins with claimed HTTPS scheme redirect URIs you must first prepare mobile and cloud infrastructure.
