# Updated SPA – Code Details

In the previous post I described the behaviour of the <a href='improved-spa-code-sample-overview.mdx'>Updated SPA and API Code Sample</a>. Next I summarise some changes to the SPA code, with a particular focus on <a href='user-sessions-and-token-renewal.mdx'>Iframe-Based Access Token Renewal</a> and its difficulties.

### SPA OAuth Configuration Changes

I use additional settings from the *oidc-client-ts* library to use the following features in the SPA:

- In-memory token storage.
- Silent token renewal via iframes.
- Logout.

The SPA's authenticator class therefore supplies additional settings to the *oidc-client-ts* library:

```typescript
public constructor(configuration: OAuthConfiguration) {

    this._configuration = configuration;
    const settings = {

        authority: configuration.authority,
        client_id: configuration.clientId,
        redirect_uri: configuration.redirectUri,
        scope: configuration.scope,
        response_type: 'code',
        userStore: new WebStorageStateStore({ store: new InMemoryWebStorage() }),
        stateStore: new WebStorageStateStore({ store: sessionStorage }),

        silent_redirect_uri: configuration.redirectUri,
        automaticSilentRenew: false,
        loadUserInfo: false,
        post_logout_redirect_uri: configuration.postLogoutRedirectUri,
    };

    this._userManager = new UserManager(settings);
}
```

### Silent Token Renewal Implementation

The SPA consists of a main window and a dynamic iframe that implements iframe redirects. JavaScript applications run on both of these windows, yet I want to avoid the need for separate HTML files or JavaScript bundles for the iframe application. Therefore, the entry point *index.ts* file now contains the following code, to detect whether the frame or top level window runs:

```typescript
if (window.top === window.self) {

    const app = new App();
    app.execute();

} else {

    const app = new IFrameApp();
    app.execute();
}
```

Initially, the iframe app does not exist. The main window creates it when it initiates token renewal. The oidc-client-ts library spins up an iframe and runs an authorization code flow with PKCE, using the OpenID Connect *prompt=none* parameter:

```typescript
private async _performAccessTokenRenewalViaIframeRedirect(): Promise<void> {

    try {

        await this._userManager.signinSilent();

    } catch (e: any) {

        if (e.error === ErrorCodes.loginRequired) {

            await this.clearLoginState();

        } else {

            throw ErrorFactory.getFromTokenError(e, ErrorCodes.tokenRenewalError);
        }
    }
}
```

An instance of the *IFrameApp* class gets instantiated when the authorization server sends a redirect response back to the SPA, with a URL of the following form, containing the authorization code:

- *https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa?code=xxx&state=yyy*

The job of the iframe app is to POST the response URL to the SPA’s main window, which then exchanges the code for tokens. The SPA then stores the tokens in-memory.

```typescript
export class IFrameApp {

    public async execute(): Promise<void> {

        try {

            const args = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
            const state = args.get('state');
            if (state) {

                const configuration = await ConfigurationLoader.download('spa.config.json');
                const settings = {
                    authority: configuration.oauth.authority,
                    client_id: configuration.oauth.clientId,
                    redirect_uri: configuration.oauth.redirectUri,
                };

                const userManager = new UserManager(settings);
                await userManager.signinSilentCallback();
            }

        } catch (e: any) {

            const uiError = ErrorFactory.getFromTokenError(e, ErrorCodes.tokenRenewalError);
            ErrorConsoleReporter.output(uiError);
        }
    }
}
```

The oidc-client-ts library uses the [PostMessage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) to send the authorization response URL from the iframe to the main window. You can use code such as the following to intercept the posted message and view the data:

```typescript
window.addEventListener('message', (evt) => {
  console.log(evt);
});
```

When the main window exchanges the code for token it uses the PKCE *code_verifier* that was saved to session storage before the iframe redirect. You can view the oidc-client-ts library’s logging output, including validation of received tokens. To do so, append *#log=debug* to the SPA URL, and also ensure that the browser console tools use the *Preserve Log* and *All Levels* options:

![oidc browser logs](../images/180/oidc-browser-logs.jpg?v=20240813)

### Updated API Flow

The SPA's *ApiClient* object now uses an updated algorithm to call APIs, that includes token refresh. I like to only trigger login redirects when one of the following conditions is true:

- There is no access token yet.
- Token refresh fails with an *invalid_grant* error code, meaning end of session.

I write the code as follows, but note that the *oidc-client-ts* library's *signInSilent* method does not return error codes, to enable my preferred logic. Therefore, if refreshing an access token fails for other reasons, like a dropped SSO cookie during an iframe redirect, this logic could lead to a redirect loop.

```typescript
private async _callApi(path: string, method: Method, dataToSend?: any): Promise<any> {

    const url = `${this._apiBaseUrl}${path}`;

    let token = await this._authenticator.getAccessToken();
    if (!token) {

        await this._authenticator.startLogin(null);
        throw ErrorFactory.getFromLoginRequired();
    }

    try {

        return await this._callApiWithToken(url, method, dataToSend, token);

    } catch (e1: any) {

        const error = e1 as UIError;
        if (error.statusCode !== 401) {
            throw error;
        }

        token = await this._authenticator.refreshAccessToken();
        if (!token) {

            await this._authenticator.startLogin(error);
            throw ErrorFactory.getFromLoginRequired();
        }

        return await this._callApiWithToken(url, method, dataToSend, token);
    }
}
```

Therefore, I use the same type of logic from the first SPA, where *startLogin* uses a time-based check to prevent redirect loops:

```typescript
private async _preventRedirectLoop(api401Error: UIError | null): Promise<void> {

    if (api401Error && this._loginTime) {

        const currentTime = new Date().getTime();
        const millisecondsSinceLogin = currentTime - this._loginTime;
        if (millisecondsSinceLogin < 1000) {

            await this.clearLoginState();
            throw api401Error;
        }
    }
}
```

### Low Security Token Storage Options

There are simpler ways to implement token refresh. For example, you can update the *oidc-client-ts* settings to those shown here. A background timer then attempts to refresh the access token by comparing the current time to the *expires_in* field from the token response. The time for iframe-based token refresh occurs in the background so you avoid impacting users. You can also avoid performing a token refresh if the user reloads the page or opens a new browser tab:

```markdown
userStore: new WebStorageStateStore({ store: localStorage }),
automaticSilentRenew: true,
```

For best reliability, you could also store a refresh token in local storage and avoid the use of iframe-based access token refresh completely. Yet persistent storage is the least secure way to manage tokens in the browser, with greatest XSS threats. When you also store refresh tokens, you make threats much worse, since an attacker can use the refresh token to get new access tokens without needing to supply a client credential.

By default, iframe-based token renewal does not work at all with AWS Cognito. To provide some kind of working demo solution with that authorization server I use a low security solution with refresh tokens stored in-memory. Usability is intentionally suboptimal, and there is a new OpenID Connect redirect (a single-sign-on event) every time you reload the page or open a new browser tab. To activate iframe-based token renewal you must set a different *provider* name in the SPA’s configuration file.

```json
{
    "app": {
        "apiBaseUrl":             "https://api.authsamples-dev.com/api"
    },
    "oauth": {
        "provider":               "cognito",
        "authority":              "https://cognito-idp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/eu-west-2_CuhLeqiE9",
        "clientId":               "hje94a2jj3lgkobkh57ikenhh",
        "redirectUri":            "https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa",
        "postLogoutRedirectUri":  "https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa/loggedout.html",
        "scope":                  "openid profile https://api.authsamples.com/investments",
        "customLogoutEndpoint":   "https://login.authsamples.com/logout"
    }
}
```


### The SPA OAuth Journey

When you implement the traditional SPA flow using only JavaScript code, you typically undergo a journey like this:

- You first store tokens in local storage, to prevent losing them during page reloads and multi-tab browsing.
- You then realise this is bad from a security viewpoint and try to use in-memory token storage to improve security.
- You must then manage page reloads and multi-tab browsing, and token refresh becomes considerably more difficult.
- You then become aware that, even with very careful code, your SPA still has security and reliability issues.

Eventually, you come to realise that to solve the security, usability and reliability conditions, you need a backend component that assists the SPA with its security and also serves the SPA to ensure the best usability and reliability. You can realise such a solution with a correctly designed <a href='spa-back-end-for-front-end.mdx'>Backend for Frontend</a> as I show later in this blog. An important part of this design is error responses that put the SPA in control.

### SPA Calls API to get User Info

Once the SPA has an access token it uses it to get two sources of user information. The SPA now explicitly sends the access token to the OpenID connect userinfo endpoint. Yet the SPA also renders user attributes not stored in the authorization server. It gets them by calling the API, then renders data from both sources in the top right of the view.

```typescript
public async load(authenticator: Authenticator, apiClient: ApiClient): Promise<void> {

    const oauthUserInfo = await authenticator.getUserInfo();
    const apiUserInfo = await apiClient.getUserInfo();

    if (oauthUserInfo && apiUserInfo) {

        const viewModel = {
            userName: this.getUserNameForDisplay(oauthUserInfo),
            title: this.getUserTitle(apiUserInfo),
            regions: this.getUserRegions(apiUserInfo),
        };

        const htmlTemplate =
            `<div class='text-end mx-auto'>
                <div class='fw-bold basictooltip'>{{userName}}
                    <div class='basictooltiptext'>
                        <small>{{title}}</small>
                        <br />
                        <small>{{regions}}</small>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>`;

        const html = mustache.render(htmlTemplate, viewModel);
        DomUtils.html('#username', html);
    }
}
```

### SPA Basic Logout

To implement logout I remove tokens from the app and then perform an OpenID Connect RP-initiated logout to remove the SSO cookie. The oidc-client-ts library does this in a one-liner. Yet AWS Cognito, like some other authorization servers, has vendor-specific logout behaviour. The SPA therefore has to implement a workaround, which is an annoyance.

```typescript
public async startLogout(): Promise<void> {

    try {

        await this.clearLoginState();
        HtmlStorageHelper.raiseLoggedOutEvent();

        if (this._configuration.provider === 'cognito') {

            location.replace(this._getCognitoEndSessionRequestUrl());

        } else {

            await this._userManager.signoutRedirect();
        }
    }
}
```

### SPA Multi Tab Logout

The sample also supports multi-tab logout, described in the earlier <a href='logout.mdx'>Logout</a> post. Rather than attempting to use single-logout solutions that send the SSO cookie from iframes, the SPA simply watches an *isLoggedOut* boolean in local storage, using the [Browser Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API).

If a user runs multiple tabs and signs out on one of them, the following code then run in all other tabs, each of which simply removes its tokens and redirects the user to the logged out view.

```typescript
private _onStorageChange(event: StorageEvent): void {

    if (HtmlStorageHelper.isLoggedOutEvent(event)) {

        this._authenticator!.onExternalLogout();
        location.hash = '#loggedout';
    }
}
```

### Where Are We?

I explained the code to complete the traditional SPA flow, with in-memory storage of access tokens, and the SSO cookie used for token refresh.
