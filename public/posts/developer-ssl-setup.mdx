# SSL Trust Configuration

Previously I explained how to use an <a href='http-debugging-setup.mdx'>HTTP Proxy</a> to trace OAuth-related requests. Next, I explain how to enable HTTPS connections for development. Future code samples use SSL for all backend connections. I use *SSL* as the colloquial term, to represent [transport level security (TLS) v1.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_1.3).

### Productive OAuth Development

When using OAuth, security components may require you to run an SSL setup on your local computer. Even when this is not the case, I prefer to do so since it is a more real-world setup and closer to production environments.

### SSL for Cloud Environments

Later in this blog I create a <a href="cloud-domain-setup.mdx">Cloud Domain Setup</a> for a deployed domain of *authsamples.com*, which runs in AWS. I then use [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) to create AWS issued certificates for these subdomains, that are trusted by clients that call the SSL endpoints.

![managed certificates](../images/110/managed-certificates.jpg?v=20241231)

I use a similar approach for a development computer, for an *authsamples-dev.com* domain. I create a wildcard certificate for the domain and its subdomains. Be aware though, that in most real deployed environments, your APIs do not directly use SSL certificates. Instead, you typically configure SSL certificates in an API gateway placed in front of APIs.

### Development Certificate Issuance

Some online tutorials create standalone self-signed certificates for *localhost* in a way that does not match real-world certificates. I prefer to instead follow these main steps:

- Create a root certificate authority for development.
- Create SSL server certificates issued by the root CA, with real-world domain names.

Doing so simplifies trust administration, since you only need to deploy root CAs. You also learn about public key infrastructures (PKI). Later, when you deploy your apps to production, certificate trust works in the same way.

### Creating SSL Certificates and Keys

I use the OpenSSL command line tool to create certificates for development. I first create an asymmetric private key and long-lived public certificate for a root authority:

```bash
DOMAIN='example'

openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out $DOMAIN.ca.key

openssl req \
    -x509 \
    -new \
    -key "$DOMAIN.ca.key" \
    -out "$DOMAIN.ca.crt" \
    -subj "/CN=Example Development CA" \
    -days 3650
```

You can create domains for development by just editing your */etc/hosts* file. To ensure that these are trusted domains when you use them in SSL connections, create an *extensions.cnf* file that references them as subject alternative names:

```markdown
[ server_ext ]
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName=DNS:example.com,DNS:api.example.com,DNS:www.example.com
```

Next, run commands to create an SSL private key and public certificate:

- Use the private key to sign a certificate signing request (CSR).
- Request an X509 certificate with the CSR.
- Act as a certificate authority that accepts the request and applies a policy to issue a certificate.
- Save the SSL key and certificate to a password protected PKCS#12 file with a *.p12* or *.pfx* extension.

```bash
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out $DOMAIN.ssl.key

openssl req \
    -new \
    -key "$DOMAIN.ssl.key" \
    -out "$DOMAIN.ssl.csr" \
    -subj "/CN=*.$DOMAIN.com"

openssl x509 -req \
    -in "$DOMAIN.ssl.csr" \
    -CA "$DOMAIN.ca.crt" \
    -CAkey "$DOMAIN.ca.key" \
    -out "$DOMAIN.ssl.crt" \
    -sha256 \
    -days 365 \
    -extfile extensions.cnf \
    -extensions server_ext

openssl pkcs12 \
    -export \
    -inkey "$DOMAIN.ssl.key" \
    -in "$DOMAIN.ssl.crt" \
    -name "*.$DOMAIN.com" \
    -out "$DOMAIN.ssl.p12" \
    -passout "pass:Password1"

rm example.ssl.csr
```

In total this results in the following files:

| File | Deployed To |
| ---- | ----------- |
| example.ca.crt | The root CA, deployed to various trust stores. |
| example.ca.key | The root CA's private key. |
| example.ssl.crt | The SSL certificate. |
| example.ssl.key | The SSL certificate's private key. |
| example.ssl.p12 | The protected key and certificate, that can be used by APIs. |

You can use an [Online Certificate Decoder](https://certlogik.com/decoder/) and paste in the *example.ssl.crt* contents to see how recipients view the server's SSL certificate:

![certificate properties](../images/110/wildcard-development-cert.jpg?v=20240728)

### This Blog's SSL Code Samples

This blog's code samples include bash scripts that you can run to create OpenSSL certificates for local development. When APIs start, they load the password-protected P12 file, then listen on SSL port 443:

```typescript
public async startListening(): Promise<void> {

    const port = this.configuration.api.port;
    if (this.configuration.api.sslCertificateFileName && this.configuration.api.sslCertificatePassword) {

        const pfxFile = await fs.readFile(this.configuration.api.sslCertificateFileName);
        const sslOptions = {
            pfx: pfxFile,
            passphrase: this.configuration.api.sslCertificatePassword,
        };

        const httpsServer = https.createServer(sslOptions, this.expressApp);
        httpsServer.listen(port, () => {
            console.log(`API is listening on HTTPS port ${port}`);
        });

    } else {

        this.expressApp.listen(port, () => {
            console.log(`API is listening on HTTP port ${port}`);
        });
    }
}
```

Is is therefore straightforward to upgrade your local connections to SSL. Tools may enable you to verify the details of the client to server connection. For example, the Google Chrome browser enables you to view SSL strength from *More Tools / Developer Tools / Security*, where you can verify that the connection uses TLS 1.3.

![local ssl](../images/110/local-ssl.jpg?v=20240728)

By default though, on a development workstation, certificates are not trusted. In the following sections I show how to resolve that both when running applications normally and when using an HTTP proxy tool.

### SSL Trust Configuration

The tricky part of managing SSL trust is to configure it across different tools and technologies, which can include all of these clients:

- Chrome Browser
- Firefox Browser
- Edge Browser
- Safari Browser
- Electron Desktop Apps
- Node.js APIs
- .NET APIs
- Java APIs
- Kotlin Android Apps
- Swift iOS Apps
- Command Line Tools

Development SSL connections can also be used from any of the following operating systems:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Android
- iOS

### HTTP Proxy Root Certificates

HTTP proxy tools use a man-in-the-middle technique to replace the root of the target URL's SSL certificate. This enables you to view traffic as HTTP, after which the proxy re-encrypts traffic with its own certificate, then routes the request to its target. The following screenshot shows MITM proxy replacing the root of the development certificates issued earlier.

![mitm cert](../images/110/mitm-cert.jpg?v=20240728)

Some corporate networks use their own SSL proxy / firewall filter that works in a similar manner way, injecting root certificates that replace the root authority of external URLs.

### Trust Bundles

To configure root certificate trust, I start by creating a local trust bundle file at *~/trusted-ca-certs.crt*. This contains root CAs that I need to frequently trust. When running this blog's code samples, the root authority to trust when tracing HTTPS requests depends whether an HTTP proxy is being used.

| Scenario | Required Trust Configuration |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| HTTP Proxy Running  | Trust the proxy root certificate. |
| HTTP Proxy Not Running | Trust the development root certificate. |

The bundle file has multiple entries as shown here:

```markdown

When you need to update certificate trust, you can either add trust for the entire bundle or just a particular root CA. The following sections show how to trust a bundle file on various platforms.

### Configure Operating System Trust

On Windows, run the *Microsoft Management Console (MMC.EXE)*, then select the *Certificate Snap In* and import the root certificate(s) under *Local Computer / Trusted Root Certification Authorities*:

![windows trust](../images/110/windows-trust.jpg?v=20240728)

On macOS you instead add the root certificate(s) to the *Keychain Access* application under *System / Certificates*, then enable the *Always Trust* option:

![macos trust](../images/110/macos-trust.jpg?v=20240728)

To trust a root CA on Ubuntu Linux I copy a file with a *.crt* extension to the system's *ca-certificates* folder, then run the command to update trusted certificate authorities:

```bash
sudo cp ~/trusted-ca-certs.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

You may need to split the root certificates into individual files. To manage updates and deletes, use the *-f* option of the *update-ca-certificates* command, to remove entries for older certificate files that no longer exist in the *ca-certificates* folder.

### Trust a Root Certificate in Browsers

Browsers mostly inherit SSL trust from their operating system default trust stores. You therefore enable certificate trust as I explain above, though there are some browser exceptions. On Firefox, you must navigate to *Options / Privacy & Security / Certificates / View Certificates / Authorities / Import* to import a root certificate. You must also do so if you run Google Chrome on Linux. When you add trust, select the option to *Trust this CA to identify websites*.

![firefox trust](../images/110/firefox-trust.jpg?v=20240728)

### Trusting a Root Certificate in Node.js APIs

In the previous HTTP proxy post I used a hack to set an environment variable, so that Node.js trusts any certificate issuer:

```bash
export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
```

A more correct option is to allow particular root CAs using the following environment variable, which I set permanently on my computer:

```bash
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=~/trusted-ca-certs.crt
```

### Trusting a Root Certificate in .NET APIs

This blog's <a href='net-core-code-sample-overview.mdx'>OAuth Secured .NET API</a> uses certificate trust inherited from the operating system SSL trust store.

### Trusting a Root Certificate in Java APIs

This blog's <a href='java-spring-boot-api-overview.mdx'>OAuth Secured Java API</a> uses certificate trust from the Java trust store. For example, on Ubuntu Linux this is at the following location when running Java 21:

```markdown
/usr/lib/jvm/zulu-21-amd64/lib/security/cacerts
```

Operations to manage certificates use the [keytool utility](https://www.techquintal.com/java-keytool-keystore-commands), and I use the following types of commands to add, find and remove trust for root certificates in a bundle file:

```bash
sudo "$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool" -import -alias mitmroot -cacerts -file ~/trusted-ca-certs.crt -storepass changeit -noprompt
sudo "$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool" -list -alias mitmroot -cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt
sudo "$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool" -delete -alias mitmroot -cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt
```

### Trusting a Root Certificate in Electron Apps

For this blog's <a href='desktop-apps-overview.mdx'>OAuth Secured Desktop Apps</a> there are two processes, which determine certificate trust with different rules:

| Area | Trust Behaviour |
| ---- | --------------- |
| Main Process | For requests from the main side of the app, [NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS may not enable certificate trust](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/10257). During development you may have to use the environment variable *NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0*. |
| Renderer Process | The Chromium browser uses the same trust store as the Google Chrome browser. |

### Trusting a Root Certificate in Command Line Tools

Command line tools usually use the default operating system trust store, so that these commands work once the tools trust root certificates:

```bash
curl https://api.authsamples-dev.com/api/companies
openssl s_client -connect api.authsamples-dev.com:443
```

When required, you can use a different certificate bundle file via an override. The OpenSSL output can provide detailed output on any trust errors.

```bash
curl --cacert ~/trusted-ca-certs.crt https://api.authsamples-dev.com/api/companies
openssl s_client -CAfile ~/trusted-ca-certs.crt -connect api.authsamples-dev.com:443
```

### Trusting a Root Certificate in iOS and Android

Mobile SSL trust has its own complexities, which are covered in the later posts on mobile setup:

- <a href='android-https-debugging.mdx'>Android HTTPS Debugging</a>
- <a href='ios-https-debugging.mdx'>iOS HTTPS Debugging</a>

### Where Are We?

I explained how to upgrade the development setup so that you can use real-world HTTPS URLs for development. When doing so you should also learn how to configure trust so that you can view OAuth-related requests.
