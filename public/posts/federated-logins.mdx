# User Authentication Behaviour

Previously I explained this blog's <a href='api-authorization-design.mdx'>API Authorization Behaviour</a>. Next I provide a brief and simplified overview of some key points that developers should understand about OAuth and user authentication.

### The OpenID Connect Code Flow

OAuth clients must never implement user authentication in code. Instead, clients run an authorization code flow to hand over authentication to the authorization server. The earlier post on <a href='basicspa-oauthworkflow.mdx'>OAuth Messages</a> explains how this works. You should then have many possible ways to authenticate users, including those listed below.

- Basic passwords, as used in this blog.
- Email, phone or one-time-password verification.
- Cryptography-backed options such as passkeys.
- External identity providers (social logins).
- External identity providers (business partners).
- Custom authentication using the authorization server's extensibility.

The authentication details are externalized to the authorization server and can evolve without needing to update code in clients. Once authentication completes, the client receives an authorization code in the browser response and swaps it for tokens, In particular, the client receives an access token from the authorization server and can call APIs in the correct manner.

### Federated Logins

If a client integrates directly with an external identity provider, an authorization code flow runs, but not against the authorization server. This is incorrect, since the client receives *foreign access tokens*, which you cannot use to secure your APIs correctly, since you cannot control the scopes and claims issued. Instead, your APIs must only ever receive access tokens issued by your authorization server. 

In a correct federated flow the authorization server runs a second authorization code flow against the external identity provider. An end-to-end flow performs the following main steps:

- Client redirects the browser to the authorization server.
- Authorization server redirects the browser to the external identity provider.
- User authenticates at the external identity provider.
- External identity provider returns an authorization code to the authorization server.
- Authorization server posts the code to the external identity provider, gets and verifies external tokens.
- Authorization server returns an authorization code to the client.
- Client posts the code to the authorization server to get tokens.

To enable such a flow, you configure a *federated login* using steps similar to the following. The authorization server can potentially choose from multiple security standards to integrate with the external identity provider:

- Register the identity provider as an authentication method in the authorization server and assign it an *Issuer URI*, *Client ID*, *Client Credential* and *Scope*.
- Register the authorization server as a client in the external identity provider and assign it a *Redirect URI*, *Client ID*, *Client Credential* and *Scope*.

### Authentication Logic

The authorization server should provide an authentication toolbox. During an authorization code flow, the user may perform various other actions in addition to the use of authentication methods, such as one or more of those listed below:

- User registration.
- Account recovery.
- Custom screens that prompt users for input.
- Custom logic that operates on data.

### Consistent API User Identity

The deeper behaviour is that user attributes from authentication flow into token issuance. For example, you use the authorization server's toolbox to ensure that access token claims, including user identities, remain the same if the user's primary authentication method changes.

You may need to use *Account Linking* to look up existing accounts from user attributes that an external identity provider returns. Without the right authorization server support, there can be damaging outcomes such as duplication of user accounts.

### Custom Authentication

At times you may run into custom authentication requirements. In such cases, avoid reverting to custom authentication code in applications. Instead, understand how the authorization server implements authentication:

- The user interacts with HTML forms that run in the browser to capture proofs of the user's identity.
- The HTML forms call authorization server endpoints that verify proofs of the user's identity.

An authorization server should provide extensibility to enable custom authentication with your own frontend forms and backend logic. The extensibility should prevent you from ever running into blocking authentication issues. For example, you should be able to integrate with an external identity provider even if it does not follow security standards correctly.

### Where Are We?

I explained how OAuth should enable your users to authenticate in many possible ways. When reviewing an authorization server's authentication capabilities, look for a good variety of built-in authentication methods, standards that enable federation and extensibility so that you can implement custom logic and custom authentication methods.
