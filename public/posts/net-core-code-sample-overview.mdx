# .NET API - Overview

Previously I explained the <a href='final-nodeapi-coding-key-points.mdx'>Final Node.js API Code Details</a>, including some behaviours from this blog's <a href='api-journey-server-side.mdx'>API Journey - Server Side</a> blog post. Next I provide an equivalent API in C# and .NET.

### Final API Code Sample Overview

This blog's API has a couple of simple endpoints that return mock data for a money-based theme of investments. The API aims to be visual and serves this blog's apps, such as the <a href='how-to-run-the-react-js-spa.mdx'>Final SPA</a> below. Running both together ensures that the API is client-focused and enables you to focus on API logs that the client generates.

### API URLs

During development the API runs as a standalone component. You can use either xUnit tests or a load test as the API client. These tests get user-level access tokens to call the API and verify some OAuth security use cases. The API accepts mock access tokens when you point it to a mock authorization server:

| Component | Base URL |
| --------- | -------- |
| API | *https://api.authsamples-dev.com:446* |
| Mock Authorization Server | *https://login.authsamples-dev.com:447* |

### Prerequisite 1: Domain Setup

First update your computer's hosts file to create domains for local development. Include the web domain and local backend-for-frontend domain if you run the SPA and API together:

```markdown
127.0.0.1 api.authsamples-dev.com login.authsamples-dev.com www.authsamples-dev.com bfflocal.authsamples-dev.com
```

### Prerequisite 2: Install OpenSSL

Install OpenSSL 3+ so that you can create development certificates and run the API over HTTPS.

### Prerequisite 3: Install .NET

Download and install the latest cross platform [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download):

![dotnet](../images/320/dotnet.jpg)

### Prerequisite 4: Install Docker

To run API tests, or the full SPA and API solution, you use Docker utility components, so install a local engine such as [Docker Desktop](https:/www/.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Prerequisite 5: Optionally Install a .NET IDE

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for C# development.

### Prerequisite 6: Optionally Install Node.js

If you want to run the SPA as well as the API, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to build the SPA's JavaScript bundles.

### Step 1: Get the Code

Close the GitHub repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.apisample.netcore
```

![repo](../images/320/repo.jpg)

### Step 2: Create SSL Certificates

Next run the following commands, to create some OpenSSL development certificates:

```bash
export SECRETS_FOLDER="$HOME/secrets"
mkdir "$SECRETS_FOLDER"
./certs/create.sh
```
To prevent SSL trust problems from tests or the browser you may need to <a href='developer-ssl-setup.mdx'>Configure .NET and Browser Trust</a> for the root certificate at the following location. 

```markdown
certs/authsamples-dev.ca.crt
```

### Step 3: Build and Run the API

Close the GitHub repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.apisample.netcore
```

![repo](../images/320/repo.jpg)

Next run the API:

```bash
./start.sh
```

The .NET HTTP server then listens on HTTPS port 446:

![running api](../images/320/running-api.jpg?v=20240915)

You can then navigate to the following URL in a browser without any SSL trust warnings:

```markdown
https://api.authsamples-dev.com:446/investments/companies
```

![browse to api](../images/320/browse-to-api.jpg?v=20240915)

### Step 4: Run Integration Tests

To run XUnit tests, the API must be pointed to a mock authorization server, so must run with a test configuration. Stop the API if it is running, then re-run it via this command:

```bash
./testsetup.sh
```

Next run tests with the following command:

```bash
./integration_tests.sh
```

This spins up a JWKS URI with an HTTPS endpoint that the Wiremock utility provides. A number of tests then make OAuth-secured API requests. These tests focus on the API's main security behaviours:
![test results](../images/320/test-results.jpg?v=20240915)

### Step 5: Run a Basic Load Test

While the API runs with a test configuration you can also run a basic load test that sends parallel API requests. This helps to ensure that the API code has no concurrency bugs:

```bash
./load_test.sh
```

The test fires batches of 5 concurrent requests at a time and also intentionally rehearses certain types of error. The expected result is 3 errors from a total of 100 requests:

![load test](../images/320/load-test.jpg?v=20240915)

The <a href='api-automated-tests.mdx'>API Automated Tests</a> post explains how tests get user level tokens without running a full authorization code flow.

### Step 6: Run a Frontend Client

You can run any of this blog's final frontend clients against the API:

- <a href='final-spa-overview.mdx'>Final SPA</a>
- <a href='final-desktop-sample-overview.mdx'>Final Desktop App</a>
- <a href='android-code-sample-overview.mdx'>Final Android App</a>
- <a href='ios-code-sample-overview.mdx'>Final iOS App</a>

To do so, follow the instructions to run the client against a local API, for example by using a *LOCALAPI* environment variable to override the default usage of a cloud API. When the frontend runs a code flow you can authenticate with this blog's test credential:

- User: *guestuser@example.com*
- Password: *GuestPassword1*

### Main Feature 1: Extensible Authorization

The API implements its security according to these two blog posts, using a JOSE library and some custom claims handling:

- <a href='jwt-access-token-validation.mdx'>JWT Access Token Validation</a>
- <a href='api-authorization-design.mdx'>API Authorization Design</a>

The overall behaviour manages OAuth security correctly while setting up the API's business logic with the authorization values it needs. These values may originate from multiple data sources and may not always be issued to tokens:

```csharp
public class CompanyService
{
    private readonly CompanyRepository repository;
    private readonly CustomClaimsPrincipal claims;

    public CompanyService(CompanyRepository repository, CustomClaimsPrincipal claims)
    {
        this.repository = repository;
        this.claims = claims;
    }
}
```

### Main Feature 2: Production Supportability

The other main objective of the API code sample will be JSON logging of API requests, to include useful technical support fields. Logging console output looks like this on a development computer:

```json
{
  "id": "57b5b054-55bc-2515-65f9-cd7f66919788",
  "utcTime": "2022-12-10T12:57:52.451Z",
  "apiName": "FinalApi",
  "operationName": "getUserInfo",
  "hostName": "UBUNTU",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/investments/userinfo",
  "clientName": "FinalSPA",
  "userId": "a6b404b1-98af-41a2-8e7f-e4061dc0bf86",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "millisecondsTaken": 372,
  "correlationId": "8debe475-41bb-6c9f-7fc6-7395d79a4b67",
  "sessionId": "f54f1734-aeba-d9a5-550c-e8c74ad3fbf9"
}
```

Meanwhile, the API also writes text files to its *logs* folder in a bare JSON format, ready for log shipping:

![bare logs](../images/320/bare-logs.jpg?v=20250315)

Optionally, you can follow the <a href='log-aggregation-setup.mdx'>Log Aggregation Setup</a> to run a Docker-based deployment of the Elastic Stack. You can then run <a href='api-technical-support-analysis.mdx'>Technical Support Queries</a> against the API's logs. This would be useful in a production system, to make sense of large volumes of API requests.

### Cloud Native Deployment

The API is cloud-native and includes some Docker and Kubernetes deployment resources. A basic deployment can be run with these commands:

```bash
./deployment/docker-local/build.sh
./deployment/docker-local/deploy.sh
./deployment/docker-local/teardown.sh
```

### Where Are We?

I summarised the key productivity behaviours of this blog's final APIs. This starts with modern code setup and a clean separation of concerns that sets up business logic for future growth. Next, APIs have a unified security model that works the same for any type of API client. Finally, APIs have an early focus on reliability.
