# API Authorization Behaviour

In <a href='user-data.mdx'>User Data Management</a> I explained how any moderately complex real-world system typically stores *core user attributes* separately to *volatile business user attributes*. You also need to deal with both types of data when you authorize requests in your API code.

In this post I suggest how to use access tokens for authorization in APIs. I summarise a few OAuth mechanisms, which you can read more about in many other OAuth resources. This post's main focus is manageability when you implement API authorization.

### Real-World API Authorization

Real-world authorization usually includes a number of fine-grained permissions. A token identifying the user is sent to one or more APIs, which might need to enforce business rules such as these:

- User *bob* has full access to orders from his own branch.
- User *bob* has read access to orders from other branches in his area.
- User *bob* has no access to orders from branches in other areas.

In some cases, end-to-end flows involve multiple APIs. Each API team should be able to manage authorization productively, without depending too much on an identity team. Achieving this outcome requires a solid access token design.

### API Authorization Steps

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables you to protect business data using access tokens. You can think of it as three main steps:

| Step | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Token Validation | Access token cryptograhic verification, to ensure the integrity of the message credential. |
| Scope Checks | Boundary checks to ensure an access token's validity for a particular area of data. |
| Claims-Based Authorization | Detailed permission checks against resources, using claims and fine-grained permissions to apply business rules. |

### Step 1: Token Validation

The <a href='jwt-access-token-validation.mdx'>JWT Access Token Validation</a> post described how an API verifies the JWT's digital signature. If the token is not valid you return a 401 error such as the below payload. Think of token validation as an entry level check to authenticate the request to the API. The API then trusts the access token's payload.

```json
{
  "code": "invalid_token",
  "message": "Missing, invalid or expired access token"
}
```

### Step 2: Scopes

In OAuth you use scopes to restrict API privileges that you grant to clients. You assign one or more scopes to the OAuth client when you register it in the authorization server. Often, a good choice is to do so based on business area, starting with high level values:

| Examples | Usage |
| -------- | ----- |
| sales | You might assign this scope for use at general API endpoints that deal with selling products to the public. |
| finance | You might use this scope for high security API endpoints that provide access to money values and operations. |
 
A client with an access token that contains only a *sales* scope can never successfully access data from *finance* API endpoints. The API would immediately reject the access token with a 403 forbidden error. This is true even if the user has finance rights in other clients.

### Scopes and Manageability

You cannot use scopes for dynamic purposes, such as different scope values per user. Aim to keep scopes fairly high level. In this blog I use a fictional *investments* scope and frontend clients need access tokens with this scope to call any endpoint of my example APIs. Creating too many scopes too early can cause productivity problems, like needing to frequently update clients with new scopes or write access token versioning code in APIs. I would only add new scopes for high privilege operations or to extend APIs to new business areas.

You don't usually need many scopes since you use claims for most authorization. Yet you should design scopes in terms of end-to-end flows. If multiple APIs call each other, they should each validate an access token and implement business authorization. When a user is present, each API should receive the user identity and its required scopes and claims in its access token. The source API can send its current access token or use OAuth token exchange to get a new one from the authorization server with different scopes. 

### OpenID Connect Scopes

In addition to business scopes, user facing applications typically use OpenID Connect built-in scopes, which represent areas of the user's personal data. These tend to be more fine-grained than business scopes.

| Examples | Usage Scenario |
| -------- | -------------- |
| openid | Allows an app to use the user's identity. |
| profile | Allows an app to get a user's name related information. |
| email | Allows an app to access a user's email related information. |

The OpenID Connect scopes show how you can restrict a client's access to fields within an object. Consider using this composition-based approach for your own APIs, when some areas of an object require higher security than others.

### Audience Restrictions

An API should require its own identity to be present in the audience (aud) claim of the access token. This claim can be either a string or an array. You can use audience restrictions in conjunction with scopes to enable or prevent access token sharing. You can set the audience(s) of an access token to match one exact API, multiple exact APIs, or use the same logical name in a set of related APIs.

### Step 3: Claims

Claims enable the deeper OAuth authorization behaviour. For each scope that the authorization server issues to access tokens, it also issues a set of claims. The <a href='managed-authorization-server-setup.mdx'>Cloud Authorization Server Setup</a> blog post explains how I configure scopes and claims for this blog's default authorization server. 

You can issue any data values as access token claims and they can vary per user, so claims are much more flexible than scopes. In more advanced use cases, APIs may not know how to authorize solely from a user ID in an access token. Instead, OAuth enables you to design solutions where the authorization server provides APIs with runtime claims, which may originate from trusted third-party systems.

### Claims Principal

After your API validates a JWT access token you use its claims in your business authorization code. For example, you can inject a *ClaimsPrincipal* object that contains claims into classes that need it. A well-designed claims principal expresses your API's main authorization data and should simplify API authorization code.

```typescript
export class CompanyService {

    private readonly repository: CompanyRepository;
    private readonly claims: ClaimsPrincipal;

    public constructor(repository: CompanyRepository, claims: ClaimsPrincipal) {
        this.repository = repository;
        this.claims = claims;
    }
}
```

Of course, you must always make all of the correct authorization checks in your API logic classes, to ensure that no client or user can access unauthorized data. As long as you ensure that there are no security weaknesses, you have some choices on how you manage claims.

### Claims and Manageability

In many real-world systems, claims in access tokens do not provide every data value that you need for authorization. For example, some systems use roles that map to fine-grained permissions representing levels of access, such as the branch rules listed at the start of this post. Sometimes these permissions are volatile and you change or remodel them often.

You should not manage volatile business permissions in your authorization server, since that can lead to productivity problems where you frequently need to redeploy the authorization server when API code changes. You usually only need to issue a few custom claims to access tokens. These values should be stable and should not change within a user's authenticated session.
 
 
### Customising the Claims Principal

In real world API authorization code, you are likely to need to combine access token claims with extra authorization values. There may be some values that you want to treat like claims in your API authorization code but not issue to access tokens.

When I first wrote this blog, the AWS Cognito authorization server did not support issuing custom claims to access tokens, yet I still wanted a useful claims principal that I could inject into business logic objects, where claims that should be in the JWT access token were readily available. I therefore designed the following claims principal.

```typescript
export class ClaimsPrincipal {
    public jwtClaims: JWTPayload;
    public extraClaims: ExtraClaims;
}
```

This type of claims object can also be useful in larger systems, when dealing with multiple user records. The *jwtClaims* could contain core user attributes from the authorization server's user account records. The *extraClaims* could contain volatile product specific user attributes, stored in user records within the business data.

API business logic can use both types of claims in the same way. Understand though that the *jwtClaims* are the true claims, which the authorization server asserts when it cryptographically signs access tokens. When possible, always issue core identity attributes that identify users to access tokens, so that APIs receive that data in a cryptographically verifiable format.

### Claims Principal Algorithm

When APIs work with tokens, claims and authorization values, it is useful to know how to customise OAuth processing and take control over claims-related objects. This blog's example APIs verify a JWT access token on every request and receive the main identifying claims in the token. The API then retrieves extra claims from a user record in the business data:

```typescript
export class OAuthFilter {

    public async execute(request: Request): Promise<ClaimsPrincipal> {

        const accessToken = BearerToken.read(request);
        if (!accessToken) {
            throw ErrorFactory.createClient401Error('No access token was supplied in the bearer header');
        }

        const tokenClaims = await this.accessTokenValidator.execute(accessToken);

        const accessTokenHash = createHash('sha256').update(accessToken).digest('hex');
        let extraClaims = await this.cache.getItem(accessTokenHash);
        if (extraClaims) {
            return new ClaimsPrincipal(tokenClaims, extraClaims);
        }

        extraClaims = await this.extraClaimsProvider.lookupExtraClaims(tokenClaims);
        await this.cache.setItem(accessTokenHash, extraClaims, tokenClaims.exp!);
        return new ClaimsPrincipal(tokenClaims, extraClaims);
    }
}
```

The algorithm uses a thread-safe memory cache that caches extra claims for future requests with the same access token. The API uses a hash of the access token as the cache key and the extra claims as the cache value. Each cache item has a time to live that does not exceed the expiry time of the access token.

This technique adds complexity to API code, so avoid it when getting started with OAuth. Instead, focus on using claims from the access token payload. Understand though, that it is common for APIs to need to cache some extra authorization-related values not issued to the access token. Some claims-related plumbing code can set up the API's business logic to authorize productively.

### This Blog's Example Claims

This blog's APIs use the following form of access token payload. When you design access tokens, imagine you had to explain your API security to a reviewer or a penetration tester. You should be able to point out how the scopes and claims lock down the access token to restrict its privileges.

```json
{
  "iss": "https://login.authsamples.com",
  "aud": "api.authsamples.com",
  "scope": "openid profile investments",
  "sub": "a6b404b1-98af-41a2-8e7f-e4061dc0bf86",
  "manager_id": "10345",
  "role": "user",
  "exp": 1714363304.086
}
```

In the token payload the scope restricts access to an *investments* business area. The scope and audience would allow the access token to be used by a small set of related APIs. A custom claim for *manager_id* provides a business user identity to the API. A custom *role* claim is issued to the access token, and the API might use it to look up volatile role permissions.

When this blog's APIs first receive a particular access token, they use the *manager_id* to look up the following extra user values from a trusted source, like a database. Therefore, these authorization values also derive from access token claims. The API authorization code uses these values in an identical way to true claims from the access token:

| Extra Claim | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Title | A business title for the user in a particular context, which is displayed by the frontend application. |
| Regions | An array claim representing a simplified version of the branches concept described at the start of this post. |

The API's main authorization rule enforces access to *company* resources using both the *role* from the access token and the *regions* array from extra claims. To gain access to a particular company, the user must be an administrator or have access to the company's region:

```typescript
private isUserAuthorizedForCompany(company: Company): boolean {

    const role = ClaimsReader.getStringClaim(this.claims.jwt, CustomClaimNames.role).toLowerCase();
    if (role === 'admin') {
        return true;
    }

    if (role !== 'user') {
        return false;
    }

    const found = this.claims.extra.regions.find((c) => c === company.region);
    return !!found;
}
```

### Where Are We?

I explained some standard OAuth security behaviours and some manageability concerns when you implement API authorization. You should design least-privilege and stable access tokens. You should also ensure a productive and setup for implementing API authorization code, so that you can easily evolve authorization logic in future, as rules change.
