# About

I'm a [Software Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-archer-6b3613153/) with an interest in separating concerns to enable the best all round architecture. The deeper problems in software are often the result of insufficient design thinking, so that solutions do not align with goals and requirements. OAuth is a great example of a design where effective separation can provide high business value.

### Blog History

I wrote this blog's main content from 2017-2019, with a focus on non-functional coded requirements during modern API, web and mobile development. I still refine content occasionally, in line with design or technology improvements that enable my requirements to be met in cleaner ways.

### Blog Technology

The content runs as a basic NEXT.js blog. When built, I can deploy its static content to AWS CloudFront and ~400 global locations, to ensure globally equal performance. The blog runs as a public website and does not use secured data or call APIs. For web applications that use sensitive data I prefer an SPA architecture.
