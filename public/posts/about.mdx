# About

I'm a long time [Software Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-archer-6b3613153/) with an interest in the art of separation. The deeper problems in software usually the result of suboptimal designs. OAuth done right is a great example of solid design choices that provide high business value.

### Blog History

I wrote this blog’s main content from 2017-2019, with a focus on non-functional coded requirements during modern API, web and mobile development. I still refine content occasionally, in line with design or technology improvements that enable my requirements to be met in more elegant ways.

### Blog Technology

The content is built as a basic NEXT.js blog and stored in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/gary-archer/apisandclients.com). I deploy it as static content to AWS CloudFront so that it performs well globally.
