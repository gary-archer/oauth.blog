# Android HTTPS Debugging Setup

Previously we enabled an initial Android setup by running the <a href='android-setup.mdx'>AppAuth Android Code Sample</a>. Next I will explain a way to view HTTPS mobile traffic from iOS simulators and devices on a development computer.

### Run the HTTP Proxy on the Host

First configure and run the HTTP proxy on the host computer, as described in our earlier write up on <a href='http-debugging-setup.mdx'>HTTPS Debugging</a>. We also need to instruct the proxy to decrypt SSL traffic, as covered for other environments in the blog post on <a href='developer-ssl-setup.mdx'>SSL Trust Configuration</a>:

### Determine the Computer’s IP Address

This value may vary depending on whether you are using an emulator or a device connected via USB. Some Android emulators may use the special value *10.0.2.2* whereas others may use the computer's network IP v4 address, which you can find in various ways, such as by running the following command:

```markdown
ifconfig | grep inet
```

### Configure Android WiFi Proxy Settings

When running on a WiFi network, select *Settings / Network & Internet / Internet*, then choose the in-use network connection. Then click the pencil icon to edit it. In the following screenshot I am connecting a real device to a proxy running on the host computer, using the host computer's IP address:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/470/network-proxy.jpg?v=20240804' alt='network proxy' />
</div>

Android emulators may alternate connectivity between WiFi and cellular. This can cause confusion when getting an HTTP proxy working, so I usually disable *Mobile Data* so that only WiFi is used:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/470/cellular-off.jpg?v=20240804' alt='cellular off' />
</div>

### Android Cellular Proxy Settings

If you do need to capture cellular traffic then browse to *Settings / Network & Internet / Internet* and edit the cellular network's properties. Under *Access Point Names / APNs* click the plus icon and add a new entry with the connection details. In the following screenshot I connect an emulator to a proxy running on the host computer, using the emulator's special IP address for the host:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/470/cellular-apn-settings.jpg?v=20240804' alt='cellular apn settings' />
</div>

### Understand Initial SSL Errors

If we now run the system browser or a mobile app on the Android device, any SSL requests will result in trust errors:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/470/ssl-trust-error.jpg?v=20240804' alt='ssl trust error' />
</div>

This is because the HTTP proxy is intercepting SSL requests at runtime and replacing the root certificate authority. To fix this we need to configure emulators and devices to trust the HTTP proxy’s root certificate.

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/470/proxy-root-ca.jpg?v=20240804' alt='proxy root ca' />
</div>

### Deploy the HTTP Proxy Root Certificate

To resolve the trust error you must get the certificate's root certificate authority file to the emulator or device. This can be done in various ways, such as by emailing the file. For the MITM proxy root CA you can just browse to a URL of *http://mitm.it* from the device or emulator.

Yet it is useful to have a general process that will work for any root certificate. First, the certificate must be converted to the *.der* format, using a command of the following form:

```bash
openssl x509 -in mitmproxy.ca.crt -out mitmproxy.ca.der -outform DER
```

You can then make the CA file available for download by placing the resulting certificate file in a folder and then running an HTTP server that exposes its files. For example, the following command uses NGINX to share a host folder at *http://localhost*, and allows files to be browsed using the NGINX *autoindex* feature:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 -v ./fileshare:/var/lib/nginx/html:ro dceoy/nginx-autoindex
```

From an emulator or device you can open Chrome and type the IP address of the host. Click a certificate file and save it to the device’s *Downloads* folder:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/470/get-proxy-root-ca.jpg?v=20240804' alt='get proxy root ca' />
</div>

### Configure Android SSL Trust

Next, navigate to *Settings / Security & privacy / Encryption & credentials / Install a certificate / CA certificate*, then select the *Install Anyway* option. Navigate to the *Downloads* folder and select the certificate. You will then see the certificate under *Settings / Security & privacy / Encryption & credentials / User credentials*:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/470/user-credentials.jpg?v=20240804' alt='user credentials' />
</div>

### Configure SSL Trust for Mobile Apps

After these changes, the Chrome Browser will trust the root certificate, but mobile apps will not and we will continue to get a trust error, since Android has its own [trusted certificate rules](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/changes-to-trusted-certificate.html).

To overcome this, first edit the Android manifest to reference an additional [network_security_config.xml](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config.html) file when running in debug mode. This authorizes the app to trust all user certificates installed on the device or emulator:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <debug-overrides>
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="user" />
        </trust-anchors>
    </debug-overrides>
</network-security-config>
```

### Understand Domain Name Service Lookup

During mobile development it can be useful to also run a local API. To support this with a real-world domain name I add a local DNS entry on my local computer:

```markdown
127.0.0.1 api.authsamples-dev.com
```

By default, devices and emulators will not recognise this domain name. If an HTTP proxy is used however, domain name resolution for *api.authsamples-dev.com* runs on the host computer and succeeds.

### View OAuth and API HTTPS Traffic

On all simulators and devices we can now view OAuth and API HTTPS messages such as those produced by the AppAuth library:

### Where Are We?

We have now completed our Android HTTP debugging setup and next we will enable the equivalent behaviour on iOS.
