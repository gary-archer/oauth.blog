# How to Run the iOS Code Sample

Previously we provided an an <a href='ios-code-sample-overview.mdx'>iOS Code Sample Overview</a> and next we will describe how to run and test the code sample. For details on getting started with AppAuth libraries, and tracing OAuth requests, see these earlier pages:

- <a href='ios-setup.mdx'>iOS Setup and the AppAuth Sample</a>
- <a href='ios-https-debugging.mdx'>iOS HTTPS Debugging</a>

### Prerequisite 1: Install Xcode

Use an up to date version of Xcode on your macOS system, so that you have access to the latest Swift and Swift UI features.

### Prerequisite 2: Install SwiftLint

This is used to make *code quality checks* and runs as a build step, so it is needed to compile our code sample. Download and run the PKG file for the latest version from the [SwiftLint Releases Page](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/releases).

### Step 1: Download the Code

The project is available [here](https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.mobilesample.ios), and can be downloaded / cloned to your local computer with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.mobilesample.ios
```

![repo](../images/550/repo.jpg)

### Step 2: Open the Project in Xcode

In Xcode the project layout looks as follows, and our Swift code is under the *Source* folder. Then run the app on a simulator, with your default *Signing and Capabilities* settings, which can be empty if required:

![project layout](../images/550/project-layout.jpg?v=20240914)

### Step 3: Understand Dependencies

We are using the following external dependencies:

| Library | Usage |
| ------- | ----- |
| AppAuth | Does the OAuth based authentication work for the app |
| Keychain Swift | Simplifies secure storage of OAuth tokens on devices |
| SwiftUI-Tooltip | A utility to help display a tooltip containing user info |

These references were added via the *Swift Package Manager* and are built as libraries:

![dependencies](../images/550/dependencies.jpg?v=20240914)

### Step 4: Run the App on a Simulator

You can now run our demo app via the *Run* icon in the Xcode toolbar. You may then get an initial prompt to *Secure your Device*, after which you will be able to login with the following test credential:

- User: *guestuser@example.com*
- Password: *GuestPassword1*

Next save the password when prompted, then navigate between views by clicking an item in the companies view or using the *Home* button:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/550/running-app.jpg?v=20240914' alt='running app' />
</div>

Logins require associated domain registration to work on your simulator. If registration fails, you will receive the following display. The cause is that a mobile deep link is incorrectly processed in the browser. The next post, on iOS infrastructure, explains how you can resolve this problem, if it impacts you.

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/550/not-found-login-response.jpg?v=20240914' alt='not found login response' />
</div>

### Step 5: Understand Configuration Settings

When our app runs it uses the API and OAuth settings from an embedded JSON configuration file named *mobile_config.json*, which you can find in the root of the project:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "apiBaseUrl":             "https://api.authsamples.com/investments"
  },
  "oauth": {
    "authority":              "https://cognito-idp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/eu-west-2_CuhLeqiE9",
    "clientId":               "2vshs4gidsbpnjmsprhh607ege",
    "redirectUri":            "https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogin.html",
    "postLogoutRedirectUri":  "https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogout.html",
    "scope":                  "openid profile https://api.authsamples.com/investments",
    "userInfoEndpoint":       "https://login.authsamples.com/oauth2/userInfo",
    "customLogoutEndpoint":   "https://login.authsamples.com/logout",
    "deepLinkBaseUrl":        "https://mobile.authsamples.com"
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Understand Login Redirects

By using AppAuth libraries the standard *Authorization Code Flow (PKCE)* message is sent.

![authorization request](../images/550/authorization-request.jpg?v=20240914)

Our AWS Cognito authorization server accepts the request and issues an authorization code because the *Client ID*, *Redirect URI* and *Scope* of the request match those configured in a Cognito OAuth client:

![oauth client 1](../images/550/oauth-client1.jpg?v=20240914)
![oauth client 2](../images/550/oauth-client2.jpg?v=20240914)

### Step 7: Understand Redirect Response Handling

The result of successful authorization is the following message, and note that this is sent to a web domain rather than directly to our iOS app:

![authorization response](../images/550/authorization-response.jpg?v=20240914)

Two intermediate web pages are used with our iOS sample, hosted at the following URLs:

- [https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogin.html](https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogin.html)
- [https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogout.html](https://www.authsamples.com/apps/finalmobileapp/postlogout.html)

If we use the *View Source* option in a desktop browser for one of the above URLs, we can see that they just forward query parameters from the login response using a deep linking URL:

![view source](../images/550/view-source.jpg?v=20240914)

For this to work we need to register the *https://mobile.authsamples.com* base URL as an *Associated Domain* in the *finalmobileapp.entitlements* file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>com.apple.developer.associated-domains</key>
	<array>
		<string>applinks:mobile.authsamples.com?mode=developer</string>
	</array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### Step 8: Understand Login Completion

Once the authorization code is received by the app, it sends an *Authorization Code Grant* request to Cognito’s token endpoint, which returns OAuth tokens in the response:

![authorization code grant](../images/550/authorization-code-grant.jpg?v=20240914)

The token data is then saved to the iOS keychain, which ensures that the data is kept private to this particular mobile app.

### Step 9: Test Login Actions

It is worth performing certain tests while the ASWebAuthenticationSession window is active, to ensure that the app does not throw exceptions or recreate views unnecessarily:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/550/login.jpg?v=20240914' alt='login' />
</div>

The first of these is to switch away from the app and then reactivate it from its shortcut. Verify that this does not cause any application problems:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/550/shortcut.jpg?v=20240914' alt='shortcut' />
</div>

Similarly I would recommend changing the screen orientation half way through login and then completing the sign in.

![landscape](../images/550/landscape.jpg?v=20240914)

### Step 10: Test Restarting the App after Login

Restarting the app after a login will just load OAuth tokens from secure storage, and a new login is not required.

### Step 11: Test Deep Linking

While the app is running we can test deep linking on a simulator via a command such as the following. If required our app performs a *login* or *token renewal* before moving to the deep link destination:

```bash
xcrun simctl openurl booted https://mobile.authsamples.com/finalmobileapp/deeplink/companies/2
```

### Step 12: Test Access Token Expiry

We can use the *Expire Access Token* and *Reload Data* buttons to cause an invalid token to be sent to the API, resulting in a 401 response:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/550/access-token-expiry.jpg?v=20240914' alt='access token expiry' />
</div>

After every API call the UI checks for 401 responses, and handles them by getting a new access token. The API request is then retried once with the new token, so that the user session is silently extended. Note that a mobile app is a public client and the refresh token is not protected with a client credential:

![concurrent refresh](../images/550/concurrent-refresh.jpg?v=20240914)

### Step 13: Test Refresh Token Expiry

We can use *Expire Refresh Token* followed by *Reload Data* to simulate the end of a user session, which might occur if a user left the app running overnight:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/550/refresh-token-expiry.jpg?v=20240914' alt='refresh token expiry' />
</div>

On the next request for data the attempt to renew the access token will fail, and the result of the refresh token grant message will be an *Invalid Grant* response:

![invalid grant](../images/550/invalid-grant.jpg?v=20240914)

This will trigger a login redirect, and the user may be prompted to sign in again, but will experience no errors.

### Step 14: Test Logout

AWS Cognito also uses a vendor specific logout solution and the logout request requires *client_id* and *logout_url* parameters. AppAuth libraries add some other standards-based parameters. The session cookie is successfully removed though, so there is a working logout solution.

![logout request](../images/550/logout-request.jpg?v=20240914)

When logout completes we are returned to the below post logout view within our app. In a real world app you could then test logging in as another user with different settings or permissions.

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/550/new-user-login.jpg?v=20240914' alt='new user login' />
</div>

### Step 15: Test Failure Scenarios

Our mobile app runs multiple views which could fail concurrently, so we implement the same *Error HyperLink Behaviour* as for our earlier React apps. The following examples cause errors that the UI must handle:

| Scenario | Instructions |
| -------- | ------------ |
| UI Error | Load data normally, then disable the network and click reload, to cause a connectivity exception |
| API Error | Long press the *Reload* button, which then sends a custom HTTP header to the API to rehearse an API 500 exception |

Our error display looks as follows after concurrent view failures. The user can click a hyperlink to see details, or press the *Home* button to retry:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/550/error-summary.jpg?v=20240914' alt='error summary' />
</div>

The summary view uses an iOS modal sheet to display a view with error details, which would help to enable fast problem resolution:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/550/error-details.jpg?v=20240914' alt='error details' />
</div>
