# APIs and Clients

The content for my blog at https://apisandclients.com.

## Running the Blog

| Step | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| npm install | First install dependencies |
| npm start | Run in development mode and open a browser at http://localhost:3000 |
| Wait for compilation | The web content may takes a minute to compile before being ready |
| ./deploy-local.sh | Run in deployed mode locally using http://localhost:3001 |
| ./deploy-aws.sh | I use this script to deploy static content to AWS CloudFront |

## Blog Technology

The blog is primarily written using MDX markdown and has minimal JavaScript logic.\
I have some particular requirements to render in these four modes:

- MDX files should render in their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gary-archer/apisandclients.com/tree/master/public/posts).
- MDX content renders from the NEXT.js development host.
- MDX content built to HTML renders from the Express web host
- MDX content built to HTML renders from the AWS Cloudfront CDN

I also use the following NEXT.js plugins:

| Plugin | Usage |
| ------ | ----- |
| remark-gfm-no-autolink | Render GitHub tables as HTML tables |
| remark-prism | Syntax highlighting for code snippets |
| rehype-slug | Add ids to h3 subheadings aso that they render as links |
